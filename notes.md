I am in control  
For I know what I must do  

I set *high goals* and *exceed* them  
I do not *fall* to lower *standards*  
I do not fall in the face of *difficulty*  
I do not fall to my own *shortcomings*  

For I know what I must do  
I am in control  
```

I am in control  
For I know what I must do  

I act to change  
I do not participate in *fluff*  
I *find* things I love and bring them *closer*  
I know the difference between love and *lust*  

For I know what I must do  
I am in control  
```
```
I am in control  
For I know what I must do  

I am a person who delivers  
I do not blame others for my own shortcomings
